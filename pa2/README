List.h - Header file for List.c
List.c - A multi-purpose List ADT that implements
         a bi-directional queue in the form of a 
         doubly linked list data structure.
ListClient.c (unaltered) - A file used solely for
                           testing the List ADT.
Lex.c - Takes in an infile, uses the List ADT
        along with a variant of the Insertion Sort
        algorithm to sort the lines in lexicographic
        order, and prints the result into an outfile.
