List.c - A multi-purpose List ADT that implements a bi-directional 
         queue of ints in the form of a doubly linked list data 
         structure.
            
List.h - Header file for List.c

Graph.c - A Graph ADT that creates adjacency list representations of 
          graphs, which consists of an array of Lists. Each List 
          corresponds to a vertex in the graph and gives the neighbors
          of that vertex.

Graph.h - Header file for Graph.c

GraphTest.c - A file used solely for testing the Graph ADT.  It traces 
              the example given by Professor Tantalo on November 21, 2014.
              The link to said example is on pages 6 and 7 of this:
              http://www.ic.ucsc.edu/~ptantalo/cmps101/Fall14/Notes/11-21-14.pdf

FindComponents.c - Uses the Graph ADT to find Finds the Strongly 
                   Connected Components of a Graph given by an infile,
                   sorts these SCCs in topological order, and prints 
                   the results into an outfile.
