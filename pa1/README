List.java - A multi-purpose List ADT that implements
            a bi-directional queue in the form of a 
            doubly linked list data structure.
ListClient.java (unaltered) - A file used solely for
                              testing the List ADT.
Lex.java - Takes in an infile, uses the List ADT
           along with a variant of the Insertion Sort
           algorithm to sort the lines in lexicographic
           order, and prints the result into an outfile.
